# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles for 2020 I'm starting them in Clojure, but there may be some Python and Java solutions as well

Currently this isn't set up to run the solutions outside of a REPL, so I'd recommend using [leiningen](leiningen.org) to install any necessary dependencies, and start up a repl with `lein repl`.

Check out [Advent of Code](ttps://adventofcode.com/2020/) for your self, it's 25 days of problems for you to solve. I've been having fun with them so far!
